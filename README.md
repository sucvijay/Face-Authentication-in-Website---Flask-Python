# Face-Detection-Login-System-for-Websites

Face authentication using Python Flask and HTML for the user interface is a robust and user-friendly authentication system. It combines the power of Python's Flask framework for back-end logic and HTML for creating an intuitive user interface. This system allows users to verify their identity by capturing their facial features through a webcam or uploaded image and comparing it with pre-registered data. It provides a secure and efficient way to grant or deny access to authorized users, making it ideal for applications like secure login systems, access control, and more.
